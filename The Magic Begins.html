    <h2>The Beginning of a Legend</h2>
    <p>
      The Harry Potter franchise started as a book, written by a British writer, Joanne Rowling—better known as J. K. Rowling—during the 1900s. She wrote seven books about a boy wizard on a train heading toward a magical school called Hogwarts. The story was later adapted into eight films, as the final book was split into two parts. The first movie was released in the early 2000s.

      <h3>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s / Sorcerer’s Stone</h3>
      <p>
        In this movie, we are first introduced to the main character, Harry Potter. He was left on the doorstep of a family by three mysterious beings. Years later, he grows up as an orphan who is mistreated by his aunt Petunia Dursley, uncle Vernon Dursley, and cousin Dudley Dursley.

        One day, Harry receives a mysterious letter addressed to him. Although his uncle tries to hide it, the letters keep coming, making Harry suspicious of his family’s strange behavior. In desperation, they flee to a lighthouse on a deserted island.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night, a mysterious giant named Hagrid bursts through the door. He reveals that Harry is a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Despite his foster family’s resistance, Harry leaves with Hagrid and begins his magical journey.
