  <h2>Mysteries of the Hogwarts Houses</h2>
  <p>
    There are 4 houses that you can get into when you enter Hogwarts. These houses were named after each of the 4 founders of Hogwarts: Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Salazar Slytherin, and Helga Hufflepuff. The sorting hat groups you based on your most prominent attributes, however, it also takes into account your preferences. For example, Harry Potter had attributes that could have made him part of the Slytherin group, however, he whispered to himself that he did not want to be there, so the sorting hat grouped him into the Gryffindor group.
