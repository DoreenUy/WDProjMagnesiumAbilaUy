## JS Incorporation  
JavaScript will be used in three major parts of the website to make it more interactive and engaging.  

First, the Hogwarts Castle Map in *Through the Halls of Hogwarts* will allow users to click on different areas of a realistic image of Hogwarts, such as the Great Hall or the Quidditch Pitch. When clicked, JavaScript will detect which part was selected, zoom in on that area, and display a pop-up with details or events related to that location.  

We will also use JavaScript for the Sorting Hat Quiz in *The 4 Houses of Hogwarts* to process user answers and determine their Hogwarts House, showing the result directly on the same page.  

These interactive elements, event detection, randomization, and logical decision-making cannot be accomplished with CSS only, making JavaScript important in bringing the magical world of Hogwarts to life on the website.
