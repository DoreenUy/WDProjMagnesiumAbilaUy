        <h3>Doreen Angela Uy</h3>
        <p>Hello! I’m Doreen, a 14-year-old student who recently watched Harry Potter. After years of hearing spoilers and hearing about it from friends, I finally decided to watch the series a few months ago. I was captivated by the magical world, the unique characters, and the intricate plotlines. This experience inspired me to help create this website to share the wonder of Harry Potter with others.</p>

        <p>Hi! I’m Schatz, a 14-year-old student who watched Harry Potter 3–4 years ago. I first discovered the series in grade 6 or 7 and immediately fell in love with the plot, the magical universe, and the characters’ journeys. Being a fan for years, I wanted to create a website that could help others explore this incredible world and share the magic that has inspired me for so long.</p>
